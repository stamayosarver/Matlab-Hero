Create a function, function(one) that runs a b c and d of the following in MATLAB 

For questions 1a, 1b, 3b, 3c, and 3d nd the answers using a direct evaluation of the
appropriate probability mass function or cumulative distribution function, and then
verify your answer using MATLABâ€™s built-in pdf, cdf , or icdf functions.
Also, note that some problems in this assignment can be practically solved using a
binomial random variable OR a Poisson random variable. Give some thought to why
that is and be prepared to discuss in class on Feb 5.
1. Newborns were screened for human immunodeciency virus (HIV) in 5
Massachusetts hospitals. At one representative hospital, 5110 tests were
performed and 44 tests were positive. If you assume the rate of positive HIV tests
remains constant, for the next 100 tests,
a) what is the probability of 0 positive tests?
b) what is the probability of more than 3 positive tests?
c) what is the expected value of the number of positive tests?
d) If the probability of an HIV infection is the same at 10,000 different hospitals,
what do you expect for the variance in the number of positive tests (from the
next 100 tests) from across these 10,000 (or any really large number) hospitals?
